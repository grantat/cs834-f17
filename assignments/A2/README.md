# Assignment #2

### Written report due 2017-10-14:

Chose 5 of: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.8 (use examples from the Wikipedia data set), 5.10, 5.14, 5.16

### Chosen questions:

> 4.1. Plot rank-frequency curves (using a log-log graph) for words and bigrams in
the Wikipedia collection available through the book website (http://www.searchengines-book.com).
Plot a curve for the combination of the two.What are the best
values for the parameter c for each curve?

> 4.2. Plot vocabulary growth for the Wikipedia collection and estimate the parameters
for Heaps’ law. Should the order in which the documents are processed
make any difference?

> 4.3. Try to estimate the number of web pages indexed by two different search engines
using the technique described in this chapter. Compare the size estimates
from a range of queries and discuss the consistency (or lack of it) of these estimates.

> 4.8. Find the 10 Wikipedia documents with the most inlinks. Show the collection
of anchor text for those pages.

> 5.8. Write a program that can build a simple inverted index of a set of text documents.
Each inverted list will contain the file names of the documents that contain
that word.
Suppose the file A contains the text “the quick brown fox”, and file B contains
“the slow blue fox”. The output of your program would be:
% ./your-program A B
blue B
brown A
fox A B
quick A
slow B
the A B
