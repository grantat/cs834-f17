# Assignment #4

### Written report due 2017-12-04:

Chose 5 of:

8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, 8.10, 9.4, 9.6, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, 9.13

Extra credit: chose up to 8 of the above, for a maximum score of 16/10

### Chosen questions:

> 8.10. Consider a test collection that contains judgments for a large number of
time-sensitive queries, such as “olympics” and “miss universe”. Suppose that the
judgments for these queries were made in 2002. Why is this a problem? How can
online testing be used to alleviate the problem?

> 9.8. Cluster the following set of two-dimensional instances into three clusters using
each of the five agglomerative clustering methods:
(–4, –2), (–3, –2), (–2, –2), (–1, –2), (1, –1), (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3)
Discuss the differences in the clusters across methods. Which methods produce
the same clusters? How do these clusters compare to how you would manually
cluster the points?

> 9.9. Use K-means and spherical K-means to cluster the data points in Exercise
9.8. How do the clusterings differ?

> 9.10. Nearest neighbor clusters are not symmetric, in the sense that if instance A
is one of instance B’s nearest neighbors, the reverse is not necessarily true. Explain
how this can happen with a diagram.

> 9.11. The K nearest neighbors of a document could be represented by links to
those documents. Describe two ways this representation could be used in a search
application.

### Presentation due 2017-11-30:

Any research paper in "references and further reading" from chapters 8 or 9
