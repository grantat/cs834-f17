# Assignment #1

### Written report due 2017-09-21:

Chose 5 of: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.12, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16

### Chosen questions:

1.2, 1.4, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.14

1.2
> Site Search is another common application of search engines. In this case, search is restricted to the web pages at a given website. Compare site search to web search, vertical search, and enterprise search.

1.4
> List five web services or sites that you use that appear to use search, not including web search engines. Describe the role of search for that service. Also describe the search is based on a database or grep style of matching, or if the search is using some type of ranking.

3.7
> Write a program that can create a valid sitemap based on the contents of a directory on your computer's hard disk. Assume the file are accessible from a website at the URL http://example.com. For instance, if there is a file in your directory called homework.pdf, this would be available at http://www.example.com/homework.pdf. Use the real modification date on the file as the last modified time in the sitemap, and to help estimate the change frequency.

3.8
> Suppose that, in an effort to crawl web pages faster, you set up two crawling machines with different starting seed URIs. Is this an effective strategy for distributed crawling? Why or why not.

3.9
> Write a simple single-threaded web crawler. Starting from a single input URL (perhaps a professor's web page), the crawler should download a page and then wait at least five seconds before downloading the next page. Your program should find other pages to crawl by parsing link tags found in previously crawled documents.

### Presentation due 2017-09-14:

Any research paper in “references and further reading” from chapters 2 or 3
